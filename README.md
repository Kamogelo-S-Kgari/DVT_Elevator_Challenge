# Elevator Simulation Console Application

This is a console application written in C# that simulates the operation of elevators within a building. The application demonstrates concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), real-time processing, and algorithmic efficiency. The project includes multiple types of elevators, passenger handling, weight limits, and efficient dispatching algorithms.

## Features

1. **Real-Time Elevator Status**:
   - The application displays the real-time status of each elevator, including the current floor, direction of movement, whether it is in motion or stationary, and the number of passengers it is carrying.

2. **Interactive Elevator Control**:
   - Users can interact with the elevators through the console application. They can call an elevator to a specific floor and indicate the number of passengers waiting on each floor.

3. **Multiple Floors and Elevators Support**:
   - The application supports buildings with multiple floors and multiple elevators, ensuring that elevators can efficiently move between different floors.

4. **Efficient Elevator Dispatching**:
   - An algorithm directs the nearest available elevator to respond to a request, minimizing wait times for passengers and optimizing elevator usage.

5. **Passenger Limit Handling**:
   - The elevators have a maximum capacity and weight limit, preventing them from becoming overloaded and handling scenarios where additional elevators might be required.

6. **Support for Different Elevator Types**:
   - The application includes different types of elevators such as standard, high-speed, and freight elevators.

7. **Real-Time Operation**:
   - The console application operates in real-time, providing immediate responses to user interactions and accurately reflecting elevator movements and statuses.
